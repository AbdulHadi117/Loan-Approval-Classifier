# Loan Approval Prediction

## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **loan approval outcomes** based on applicant financial and personal information.

The aim is to explore **which factors most influence loan approval** and compare multiple machine learning models for classification accuracy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preprocessing

* **Outlier Treatment**
  * Outliers represent **genuine high-wealth applicants** and were  **not removed** .
  * Removing them would bias the sample and discard predictive information.
  * Tree-based models naturally handle outliers; for linear models, transformations were applied.

* **Box-Cox Transformation**
  * Applied on skewed asset values.
  * Helps stabilize variance and improve performance of logistic regression.
  * Original + transformed versions kept for A/B testing.

* **Target Variable Distribution**
  * Approved: **62.2%**
  * Rejected: **37.8%**
  * Dataset moderately imbalanced but not severe ‚Üí No oversampling needed.

## üîç Feature Selection

### **Correlation Analysis**

* **Strongest Predictors:**

  * **CIBIL Score (r = ‚Äì0.77)** ‚Üí Strong negative correlation with rejection
  * **Loan Term (r = 0.11)** ‚Üí Weak but relatively strongest positive correlation
* Other features showed negligible linear correlation.

### **Random Forest Feature Importance**

* **Top Predictors:** CIBIL Score, Loan Term, Loan Amount
* **Moderate Predictors:** Annual Income, Luxury Assets, Residential Assets (Box-Cox)
* **Low Predictors:** Bank Assets, Commercial Assets, Dependents, Education, Self-Employed![1755792776023](image/README/1755792776023.png)

### **Overall Insight**

* **Core Predictors:** CIBIL Score, Loan Term
* **Supportive Predictors:** Loan Amount, Annual Income, Luxury Assets, Residential Assets
* **Weak Predictors:** Bank Assets, Commercial Assets, Dependents, Education, Self-Employed

## ü§ñ Model Implementation

### 1. **Decision Tree**

* **Accuracy:** 97.6%
* **Highlights:** Balanced performance across both classes.

### 2. **Random Forest**

* **Accuracy:** 98.4%
* **Highlights:** Best performing model, high precision and recall for both classes.

### 3. **Logistic Regression**

* **Accuracy:** 82.5%
* **Highlights:** Performs significantly worse than tree models, struggles with minority class recall.
